I developed functions for working with m-bit integers numbers. The library supports numbers up to 2048 bits long. The following operations were be implemented:

1) adding numbers;
2) subtraction of numbers;
3) multiplication of numbers, raising numbers to the square;
4) division of numbers, finding the remainder of the division;
5) raising the number to a multi-digit degree;
6) conversion (translation) of a number into a character string and inverse conversion character string in number;
The class has hexadecimal support.

There also were realised: 
1) calculation of GCD and LCM of two numbers;
2) adding numbers modulo;
3) subtraction of numbers modulo;
4) multiplication of numbers and subtraction of numbers to the square modulo;
5) raising the number to multi-digit power d modulo n.


Modular arithmetic was implemented on the basis of Barrett's reduction, exaltation to the extent - based on the Horner scheme.
 
There were also compared time of operations performed using algorithms and Python tools.
